# Welcome to my website!

I am a General Physician with a Master's in Healthcare Administration from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Currently, pursuing my Master's in the Clinical Research Scholars Program at Case Western Reserve University. I intend to combine my clinical expertise as a general physician with training in healthcare management and ongoing clinical research education to create meaningful improvements in patient care. 

Outside of the curricular work, I like to indulge in multicultural experiences through music, art, and food, and I also enjoy learning new languages.


I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:ssj82@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
